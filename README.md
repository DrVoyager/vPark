# the vPark Project

GENI allowed users to create VMs and use Linux CLI (the command line interface) to invoke or execute commands. In this project, we have improved this interface to provide GUI (graphical user interface) to GENI VMs so that we can provide laboratory projects and functions that are inherently GUI oriented (e.g., Firefox and WebGoat.) On top of it, we created several security-related experiments on GENI, including cryptography, web security, privilege escalation, etc.
